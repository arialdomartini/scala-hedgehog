## Differences to Haskell Hedgehog

This page documents where the Scala Hedgehog API deviates significantly from the Haskell version.

- [State Vars](#state-vars)

## Result

The Haskell version allow for assertions throughout the `Property` monad, but the final value is
[()](https://github.com/hedgehogqa/haskell-hedgehog/blob/694d3648f808d2401834c3e75db24b960ee8a68c/hedgehog/src/Hedgehog/Internal/Property.hs#L133).

```haskell
prop_reverse :: Property
prop_reverse =
  property $ do
    xs <- forAll $ Gen.list (Range.linear 0 100) Gen.alpha
    reverse (reverse xs) === xs
```

And the corresponding Scala version:

```scala
def propReverse: Property =
  for {
    xs <- Gen.alpha.list(Range.linear(0, 100)).forAll
  } yield xs.reverse.reverse ==== xs
```

### Resource Management

This approach makes it more difficult to isolate resource management in a strict language like Scala.
It then becomes fairly important in the Haskell version to use
[ResourceT](https://github.com/hedgehogqa/haskell-hedgehog/blob/master/hedgehog-example/src/Test/Example/Resource.hs):

```haskell
prop_unix_sort :: Property
prop_unix_sort =
  property $ do
    values0 <- forAll $ Gen.list (Range.linear 0 100) Gen.alpha
    test . runResourceT $ do
      dir <- Temp.createTempDirectory Nothing "prop_dir"
      ...
      values0 === values
```

To simplify this, and to reduce surprises, the final result in the Scala version is now a separate
[Result](https://github.com/hedgehogqa/scala-hedgehog/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/hedgehog/core/Result.scala) value,
which forces a single, final assertion to be returned.

```scala
def propUnixSort: Property =
  for {
    values0 <- Gen.alpha.list(Range.linear(0, 100)).forAll
  } yield {
    val dir = java.io.Files.createTempDirectory(getClass.getSimpleName).toFile
    try {
      values0 ==== values
    } finally {
      dir.delete()
    }
  }
```


### Property Plus Example

The Scala version has an additional data type that allows generators to be applied to the final "test" in a way that
can be invoked from by consumers.

```scala
def propReverse: PropertyR[List[Char]] =
  PropertyR(
    Gen.alpha.list(Range.linear(0, 100)).forAll
  )(xs => xs.reverse.reverse ==== xs)
```

Here is an example of re-using the same method with both a property and a "golden" example test:

```scala
  def tests: List[Test] =
    List(
      property(propReverse)
    , example(propReverse.test(List('a', 'b', 'c')))
    )
```


## Monadic Gen

One of the original goals of the Haskell implementation was to support completely generic monadic values.

> Generators allow monadic effects.

For example you could use a `StateT` as part of the generator. In a strict language like Scala the Monad is also
_critical_ for providing a lazy tree. However, putting the laziness on _each_ tree node results in _serious_ memory
problems. For now we have had to move this laziness to the tree children.

In practice I doubt that many people are seriously using monadic effects for generated values, and I'm happy to revisit
this if/when an issue is raised.


## State Vars

The Haskell State testing uses a very powerful `Symbolic` and `Concrete` [types][sc_types] to represent the different
states of a variable when implementing the `Command` interface.

While this is _technically_ possible in Scala, the types are quite intimidating, especially `HTraversable`.
Instead we opt for a lower-level variable "lookup" by passing in the `Environment` map where concrete variables are
available, so that users can resolve them manually.
